# Course Structure


In this first lesson, you’ll program your computer to remember numbers and text using variables, and 
you’ll get to use variables to do lots of calculations that us humans can’t do!

In lesson 2, you’ll get to teach your computer how to make decisions when faced with multiple choices. 
This is called conditional programming or control flow.

Then in lesson 3, you’ll get to write your own set of instructions for computers to follow using functions.

In Lesson 4, you’ll write programs that can repeat instructions over and over, billions of times if needed, using loops.

By the end of Lesson 4, you should be ready to work on your first big project! You’ll need to install some tools to get started, 
but don’t worry, we’ll walk you through that step by step
