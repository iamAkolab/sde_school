# This is lesson 2 Control Flow and Condtionals

## Order of Operations (for Logical Operators)
* Just like how math operators (*, /, +, -) have an order that they are evaluated in, ie. multiplication is evaluated before addition, so do logical operators!
* The ! operator will be evaluated first, then &&, and finally ||. If you have a bunch of the same operations in an expression, like multiple || combinations, then you just operate from left to right.
* To change the order of operations you can surround expressions in parentheses because parentheses will be evaluated before anything else.

So, the order of operations is:
* Parentheses
* NOT !
* AND &&
* OR ||

For the expression:
* !true || false && true

This will have the NOT ! operator evaluated first, so this simplifies to:
* false || false && true.

Then the AND && operator will be evaluated. The combination false && true equals false, and the whole expression becomes:
* false || false
Finally the OR || operator will be evaluated, and the whole expression evaluates to false.
