# Collections

## Java Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets.

### Limitations
You need to know the number of elements you want to use in the array while initializing it
Once you initialize an array with a specific number, You are not allowed to add or remove any cell.

items of the same type. They include List, Stack, Map and Queue.
