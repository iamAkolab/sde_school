/*
Constructors
Constructors are special types of methods that are responsible for creating and initializing an object of that class.

Creating a constructor
Creating a constructor is very much like creating a method, except that:

Constructors don't have any return types
Constructors have the same name as the class itself
They can however take input parameters like a normal method, and you are allowed to create multiple constructors with different input parameters.

Here's an example of a simple constructor for a class called Game
*/

class Game{
   ...
   // Constructor
   Game(){
      // Initialization code goes here
   }
   ...
}

/*
Default constructor
A Default constructor is one that doesn't take any input parameters at all!

It's optional, which means if you don't create a default constructor, Java will automatically assume there's one by default that doesn't really do anything.

However, if the class has fields that need to be initialized before the object can be used, then you should create one that does so.

For example, assume we have a class Game that has an integer member field score, we'd like to make sure that any object of type Game will start with the score 
value set to 0. To do so, we need to create a default constructor that will initialize the mScore field
*/

class Game{
   int mScore;
   // Default constructor
   Game(){
      // Initialize the score here
      mScore = 0;
   }
}

/*
Parameterized constructor
As we've mentioned earlier, a constructor can also take input parameters.

Let's assume that some games start with a positive score value and not just 0, that means we need another constructor that takes an integer parameter as an input, 
and uses that to initialize the score variable.
*/
class Game{
   int score;
   // Default constructor
   Game(){
      score = 0;
   }
   // Constructor by starting score value
   Game(int startingScore){
      score = startingScore;
   }
}

/*
Accessing a constructor
Unlike normal methods, constructors cannot be called using the dot . modifier, instead, every time you create an object variable of a class type the appropriate constructor is called. Let's see how:

The new keyword
To create an object of a certain class, you will need to use the new keyword followed by the constructor you want to use, for example:

Game tetris = new Game();
This will create an object called tetris using the default constructor (i.e. tetris will have an initial score value of 0)

To create a game that is initialized with a different starting score you can use the second constructor:

Game darts = new Game(501);
The null keyword
If you do not initialize an object using the new keyword then its value will be set to something called null. null simply refers to an empty (uninitialized) object. null objects have no fields or methods, and if you try to access a null object's field or call its method you will get a runtime error.

In some cases, you might want to explicitly set an object to null to indicate that such object is invalid or yet to be set. You can do so using the assignment operation:

Game darts = null;
