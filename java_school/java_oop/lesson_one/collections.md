# List
In Java List is an interface, and ArrayList and LinkedList are two common implementation for List. The differences between ArrayList and LinkedList 
are ArrayList uses dynamic array where LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store elements. I will detail the differences next.

One problem with array is, once the size is defined, you will have to stick with the size. If you have an integer array like

A[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} 
And the statement below will result in a run-time exception.

A[10] = 10;
