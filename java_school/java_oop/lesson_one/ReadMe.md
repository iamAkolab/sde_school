# LESSON 1 The World of Objects

This lesson provides an introduction to object-oriented programming, and also explains how to use classes and objects in Java.

* Fields
* Methoda
* Objects and Classess

## Why Use Objects
* Objects combine variables together to make yor code meaningful.

## Fields
* The fields of an object are all the data variables that make up that object. 
* They are also sometimes referred to as attributes or member variables.
* For example a book object may contain fields like title, author and numberOfPages.
Then a library object may contain a field named books that will store all book objects in an array.

### Accessing fields:
Accessing a field in an object is done using the dot modifier ‘.’

For example, if we had an object called book that contains these fields:

String title;
String author;
int numberOfPages;
To access the title field you would use

book.title
