# Self Reference
Sometimes you'll need to refer to an object within one of its methods or constructors, to do so you can use the keyword this.

this is a reference to the current object â€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can refer to any field of the current object 
from within a method or a constructor by using this.

# Using this with a Field
The most common reason for using the this keyword is because a field has the same name as a parameter in the method or constructor

For example, if a Position class was written like this

```
class Position {
   int row = 0;
   int column = 0;

    //constructor
   Position(int r, int c) {
      row = r;
      column = c;
   }
}
```

A more readable way would be to use the same names (row & column) for the constructor parameters which means you will have to use the this keyword to seperate 
between the fields and the paramters:

```
class Position {
   int row = 0;
   int column = 0;

    //constructor
   Position(int row, int column) {
      this.row = row;
      this.column = column;
   }
}
```
In the second snippet, the constructor Position accepts the parameters row and column, but the class Position also includes two fields with the exact same name.

Using this.row compared to row means that we are referring to the field named row rather than the input parameter.
