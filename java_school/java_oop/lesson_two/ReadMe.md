# User Interactions

## Runtime Inputs
There are 4 different ways a Java program can read input from the user:

* Runtime input
* Files
* Command line arguments
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
We will be covering the first 3 types in details this lesson, and you will need to use all of them to complete the project.

## GUI
GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a totally different story and won't be covered in this course. In short, it allows you to create buttons and 
move images and colors. It certainly makes any application you build look much cooler, so it's worth checking out.

## Java for Android
If you are planning to use Java mainly to build Android applications then don't worry about learning any GUI yet. Android has its own layout system 
and it's really easy to learn.
